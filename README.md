# Advent of Code CLI

I am starting this project in late December of 2023 as an idea to provide a starter CLI for AoC challenges that would function as the driver for each day's challenge. Let's see how it goes. Maybe it will expand to include some basic code-generation for the challenges. Right now the possibilities are endless. The reality will be limited. Of that I am certain.

The CLI is written in Go. It uses Go modules to manage dependencies. It also uses the following Go packages.
- [`Cobra`](https://cobra.dev/) - [GitHub](https:/github.com/spf13/cobra)
- `Viper` - [GitHub[(https://github.com/spf13/viper)
